I am a public health researcher with an interest in the intersection of social epidemiology and biostatistical methods. My work has a broader theme of mental health (depression, anxiety, suicide) in vulnerable populations, urban health disparity focusing on health consequences of residential instability, housing crisis, and socioeconomic factors, as well as methods for spatial analysis, particularly in the small-area scale. The metric of health disparities I am interested in includes life expectancy and year of potential life loss, hospital readmission rates, and the healthcare service utilization rate. I have also worked in the area of health, economic, and behavioral disruptions brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic such as in the spending on food and alcohol, or utilization of telehealth services. I use advanced statistical modeling such as techniques of causal inference and Bayesian inference that has added advantage over traditional statistical tools commonly used in public health research. I have worked and published papers analyzing data of various natures, including survey data, electronic health records of patients, vital statistics data, satellite imagery data, and experimental laboratory data.
